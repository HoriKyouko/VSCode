    What I need:
    1. Number of TestCases
    2. Number of GBuses
    3. Tuple of (x,y) where x is the start and y is the end.
    The start is the city starting point and the end is the 
    city destination and it is inclusive so all numbers
    between x and y count as well.
    Each bus has a tuple to itself. Some buses go through the
    same cities and this is allowed.
    There are N buses so there should be n tuples.
    The next is the number of cities we want to track,
    followed by the number of that city.

    GOAL: Find how many buses run through the particular cities
    we are tracking.

    OUTPUT: "Case #Ti:" where i is the testcase.
